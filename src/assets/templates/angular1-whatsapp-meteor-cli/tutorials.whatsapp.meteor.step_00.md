Start by installing the `Meteor` platform if you haven't already (See [reference](https://www.meteor.com/install)).

Create a new project by running these commands in your command line:

    $ meteor create whatsapp
    $ cd whatsapp

Your app now contains a live and ready example. To run our app simply type the following on the command line:

    $ meteor

We can also run our app inside the `iOS` simulator or `Android` emulator, we just need to add the platform so `Meteor` will build the project for the new platform:

    $ meteor add-platform ios

Or

    $ meteor add-platform android

You can find more information about `Meteor` CLI and build tool here:

[https://www.meteor.com/tool](https://www.meteor.com/tool)

For now, letâ€™s remove unnecessary files:

    $ rm -rf server client

Next, we will replace `Blaze` (`Meteor`'s default templating engine) with `AngularJS`'s template engine:

    $ meteor remove blaze-html-templates
    $ meteor add angular-templates

We also need to make sure `Ionic` is installed:

    $ meteor add dab0mb:ionic-assets
    $ meteor npm install ionic-scripts --save

And finally, we will install `angular-meteor`:

    $ meteor npm install angular-meteor --save

Dependent libraries like `AngularJS` will be added automatically so you shouldn't worry about that.
